# Data-Structures

## Problem Statement
Implement a Red Black Tree data structure. That is
- a binary tree
- each node is either red or black
- Supports the following operations
    - insert
    - delete
- tree can be re-arranged and re-painted when modified
- the length of the longest root-leaf path should be no more than twice that of the shortest
- maintains the following invariants
    1. A red node cannot have a red child
    2. Every root-leaf path contains the same number of black nodes
